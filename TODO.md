# For release

* Make code more portable -- probably not full cmake though.
* At least make the test/bench frameworks consistent.
* Make a nonuniform builder?  Or remove the uniform builder and use pointers??
* File-handling / ser / deser API.
* Demo: CRL compression.
* FIXME BUG: nonuniform maps don't work if an item has zero population.

# Longer term

* Better interface for tile matrices
* Complete multi-threading
* Test on very large data sets (eg 1 billion)
* Prove correctness
* Once correctness is proved, it may give insights on optimal matrix shapes.
* Comprehensive unit tests.
* Make production-quality.
